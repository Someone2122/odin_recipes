    <p>
        These deviled eggs are delicious and always popular at our holiday parties. This recipe adds diced onion and
        celery to
        the creamy mayonnaise filling for a little more texture.

    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: This recipe yields 12 deviled egg halves, so you’ll need six boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise makes the filling extra creamy.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A teaspoon of white sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Vinegar: A teaspoon of white vinegar, meanwhile, cuts the sweetness with acidity.</li>
